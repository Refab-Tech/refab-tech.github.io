intro: 
  - excerpt: 'In conventional electronic scrap recycling, PCBs are ground to dust, along with all the information encoded within them. If, however, prior to recycling, electronic devices are meticulously disassembled in a learning environment and the parts & knowledge used to build new devices, the students of this practice get to learn from the gold standard of electronics design. This is **The Art Of ReFab**.'
